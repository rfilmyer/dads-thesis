# dads-thesis
Found my dad's ChemE master's thesis from 1981. Trying to run the programs.

## Status
### Programs
My dad's thesis has 3-4 programs.

* `cahn.for` - typed up but no proofreading yet.

### Reproducibility

* **Running code:** I have not gotten this code to compile yet. I believe it to be F66, it may be F77.
* **Dataset:** One may be in a different appendix.
