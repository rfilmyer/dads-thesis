# dads-thesis
Found my dad's ChemE master's thesis from 1981. Trying to run the programs.

## Status
### Programs
My dad's thesis has 2 programs.

* `cahn.for`: log-normal distributions - typed up but no proofreading yet.
* `canag.for`: normal distributions - not typed up yet

### Reproducibility

* **Running code:** I have not gotten this code to compile yet. I believe it to be F66, it may be F77.
* **Dataset:** One may be in a different appendix.
